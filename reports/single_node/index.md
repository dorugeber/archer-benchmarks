## 1. Introduction

In a [previous report](https://github.com/hpc-uk/archer-benchmarks/blob/master/reports/initial_comparison/index.md) we
compared the performance of a number of different Intel Xeon-based UK national HPC systems using a range of different benchmarks;
including both application benchmarks and synthetic benchmarks. In this report we broaden the study to compare the 
performance of different processor architectures for the application benchmarks. To reduce the complexity of the comparisons,
we restrict the results in this report to single node only. This allows us to compare the performance of the different
compute node architerctures without the additional complexity of also comparing different interconnect technologies and
topologies. Multi-node comparisons will be the subject of a future report.

As before, the approach taken is to try and evaluate the performance that a standard user would see on the systems.
In particular, this means that large amounts of effort have not been put into optimising the applications used for the application benchmarks in the system. We have used standard central installations of packages where they exist, are accessible to standard users, and have the functionality required for the benchmarks. If central installations do not exist, the applications have been compiled in the standard, recommended way for the systems. All benchmarks have been run on the systems in general production, *i.e.* other user jobs are running as usual when the benchmarks are running. This allows us to experience the same system conditions and potential variability in performance that normal users would see. 

All of the raw data and analysis of the data are available under an Open Source licence from Github at:

-   <https://github.com/hpc-uk/archer-benchmarks>

Along with the analyses, a major goal of this initiative is to present an open set of results and analysis that can be added to by interested parties and built on and used for further analysis by groups other than ourselves. This philosophy of open contribution and public visibility mirrors that found in the Open Source and Open Data movements and, it is hoped, will allow everyone to extract the most value possible from the benchmarking data.

The benchmark applications and benchmark cases were selected with the input of the user community from ARCHER: the UK national supercomputing service. The approach to choosing the benchmarks is described in more detail in an ARCHER white paper:

-   [UK National HPC Benchmarks (PDF)](http://www.archer.ac.uk/documentation/white-papers/benchmarks/UK_National_HPC_Benchmarks.pdf)

The remainder of this paper is organised in the following way. Section 2 describes the HPC systems included in this study; Section 3 presents the performance limits (in terms of floating point and memory performance) for the systems; Section 4 looks at the differences in performance across different application benchmarks. We conclude with a summary of the results and discussion of future work in this area in Section 5.

## 3. Performance Limits

To help understand the benchmark performance we have calculated the theoretical peak floating point performance for 
each of the systems and also measured the memory bandwidth using the STREAM benchmark (run within the [HPC Challenge
synthetic benchmark suite](https://icl.utk.edu/hpcc/)). STREAM is a simple synthetic benchmark program that measures
sustainable memory bandwidth.

[Table 5](#tab5) details the theoretical single precision (SP) floating point performance for each of the systems used in our exercise
and [Table 6](#tab6) shows some of the processor charateristics used to compute the CPU GFLOP/s performance figures. (Double
precision performance is half the single precision value). The 
compute nodes with GPU accelerators have by far the highest theoretical floating point performance. Of the CPU-based systems,
the Peta4-Skylake nodes (Intel Xeon Skylake Gold) have more than twice the theoretical floating point performance of the
next highest performing CPU nodes (Cirrus, Intel Xeon Broadwell). The Isambard (Marvell ThunderX2) copmpute nodes have similar
theoretical performance to the Cirrus and Athena Broadwell systems with the Tesseract (Intel Xeon Skylake Silver) and 
Thomas (Intel Xeon Broadwell) compute nodes having lower floating point 
performance and ARCHER (Intel Xeon Ivy Bridge) compute nodes having the lowest theoretical maximum floating point performance.
All of these calculations assume that any processer turbo modes (that can increase the clock speed) are not employed. This 
assumption may not hold in some use configurations but should not have a large effect on the ordering of the performance.

<a id="tab5"></a>Table 5: Theoretical maximum floating point performance for different platforms. CPU FLOPS are computed as
(number of cores used) &times; (single precision FLOPS per cycle) &times; (frequency). See [Table 10](#tab10) for values used for the different
systems. GPU FLOPS are computed as (number of GPUs used) &times; ([GPU single precision FLOPS reference value](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tesla-p100/)). (Assuming base clock frequency without turbo mode.) Each P100 GPU has 56 Streaming Multiprocessors each of which gives 128 SP FLOPS/cycle, leading to 7168 SP FLOPS/cycle per GPU.

The results from the STREAM Triad metric running on all cores on a compute node simultaneously (StarSTREAM) are shown in [Table 7](#tab7).
The Triad metric is the most complex kernel within STREAM and is considered the most relevant for HPC. The STREAM Triad kernel
corresponds to:

```
for (i =0; i<N; i++) { 
    a[i] = b[i] + c[i] * SCALAR;
}
```

For the StarSTREAM Triad benchmark, the two Intel Xeon Skylake systems (Tesseract, Skylake Silver, and Peta4-Skylake,
Skylake Gold) show the highest per core memory bandwidth with the Marvell ThunderX2 Arm64 system (Isambard) having the
highest per-node memory bandwidth.

## 4. Application Benchmarks

In this initial performance comparison, we have run three benchmarks using three different applications:

-   [CASTEP](#castep): Al Slab benchmark (not on GPU systems)
-   [OpenSBLI](#osbli): Taylor-Green vortex 512^3 benchmark (not on GPU systems)
-   [GROMACS](#gromacs): 1400k atom benchmark

More details on these benchmarks are found in the individual sections below.

A rendered Python notebook with the analysis used to produce the perfomance data reported below can be found on GitHub at:

The CASTEP application does not currently support execution on GPU accelerators (although this functionality is currently
under development by the CASTEP team) so we only include results for CPU-based systems.

We have measured the performance of the **Al Slab (al3x3)** benchmark that is able to run on small node counts. We expect the single-node performance of this benchmark to depend on the floating-point performance of the processors. This is a strong scaling benchmark. This benchmark uses double precision floating point operations (as is used in practice by users).

**Note:** *Strong scaling* is where the number of parallel processes/threads is increased while the problem size is kept the same. This generally leads to each process/thread having less computational work as the number of processes/threads is increased.

We compare the single-node performance in [Table 9](#tab9). The performance is measured in mean SCF cycles per second (i.e. 1 / mean SCF cycle time). All the raw data for the table can be found in the repository linked above.

To try and understand what characteristic of the compute nodes on the different systems is leading to the observed
performance differences, we assess the correlation between floating point performance and the CASTEP benchmark
performance. We also compute the correlation between the CASTEP benchmark performance and memory performance,
both in terms of peak bandwdth and in terms of the number of memory channels. To measure the correelation we have used two different tests:

-   Pearson correlation test: this assesses the level of correlation between the values from two datasets. This value varies between -1 (absolute negative correlation) and +1 (absolute postive correlation).
-   Spearman rank-order correlation test: this assesses the level of correlation between the ordering of the values from two datasets. As for Pearson, this value varies between -1 (absolute negative correlation) and +1 (absolute postive correlation).

[Figure 1](#fig1) plots the CASTEP performance against node floating point performance for the different systems studied and [Table 10](#tab10) shows the correlation coeffients for the CASTEP benchmark with different aspects of the compute nodes. CASTEP benchmark performance is very strongly correlated to floating point performance (particularly GFLOP/s) - both quantitatively and in rank order. This is due to the fact that, on a single node, most of the time for this CASTEP benchmark is spent in LAPACK numerical routines which are well-optimised to exploit the maximum floating point performance from the processors. Conversely, there is effectively no correlation between CASTEP benchmark performance and the memory aspects of the compute nodes. The scatter plot also shows that the system furthest from the correlation line is Isambard (Marvell Arm ThunderX2) impying that this system is not exploiting the floating point performance as well as the other systems.

### 4.2 OpenSBLI

[OpenSBLI](https://opensbli.github.io/) is a high-level framework for finite-difference based models, particularly for CFD simulations. It uses a Python-based Domain Specific Language (DSL) which can then generate C++ source code with (optionally) OpenMP, CUDA, OpenCL or OpenACC components for a variety of computer architectures (e.g. CPU, GPGPU). This benchmark uses double precision floating point operations (as is used in practice by users).

The OpenSBLI 512^3, Taylor-Green vortex benchmark was supplied by the UK Turbulence Consortium.

We are currently working to get the GPU version of OpenSBLI running correctly on GPU nodes.

[Table 12](#tab12) shows the single-node performance for the benchmark on the different systems.

If we look at the correlation coefficients for OpenSBLI benchmark performance compared to the different system aspects ([Table 13](#tab13))
it appears that the performance is not strongly correlated to either floating point performance or memory performance although there are
possible correlations to floating point performance (in terms of GFLOP/s) and number of memory channels suggesting that both these aspects
of the systems may be important for the performance of this benchmark.

<a id="tab13"></a>Table 13: Correlation coefficients for different aspects of systems hardware correlated to performance of
the OpenSBLI 512^3, Taylor-Green vortex benchmark.

| Aspect                                     | Pearson | Spearman |
|--------------------------------------------|--------:|---------:|
| Floating Point Performance (SP GLOP/s)     |  0.74   |  0.85    |
| Floating Point Performance (SP FLOP/cycle) |  0.35   |  0.18    |
| Memory Bandwidth                           |  0.06   | -0.14    |
| Memory Channels                            |  0.71   |  0.48    |

Looking at a plot of the performance data against floating point performance for the different processors ([Figure 2](#fig2)) we can
see that there are two clear outliers:

- the Isambard system which sees much greater OpenSBLI performance than we would expect based on its floating point performance alone;
- the Thomas system which sees much poorer peformance than we would expect based on its floating point performance alone.

<a id="fig2"></a>Figure 2: Scatter plot of OpenSBLI performance vs. floating point performance for the OpenSBLI 512^3, Taylor-Green vortex benchmark
<img src="img/osbli_corr_fp.png" />

Removing these outliers and repeating the correlation analysis reveals strong correlation between OpenSBLI performance and nodes floating
point performance ([Table 14](#tab14)) for the remaining systems.

<a id="tab14"></a>Table 14: Correlation coefficients for floating point performance  correlated to performance of
the OpenSBLI 512^3, Taylor-Green vortex benchmark for subset of systems (without Isambard or Thomas).

| Aspect                                     | Pearson | Spearman |
|--------------------------------------------|--------:|---------:|
| Floating Point Performance (SP GLOP/s)     |  0.97   |  0.90    |
| Floating Point Performance (SP FLOP/cycle) |  0.91   |  0.67    |

The Isambard performance, which is higher than expected based on floating point performance alone, could potentially be explained by the 
additional memory performance available on this architecture (mre memory channels, more potential for cache reuse as more cores share L3 cache,
more memory bandwidth available per node) that allow the floating point units to be used more effectivly. The Thomas performance, which is lower
than would be expected based on floating point performance alone, is not understood at the moment. For both of these outliers further investigation
is required to understand the performance differences.

We expect GROMACS performance to be directly correlated to floating point performance of the resources used and looking at a plot of
GROMACS performance against floating point performance ([Figure 3](#fig3)) and correlation
coefficients ([Table 17](#tab17)) we can see that this is generally true although, perhaps surprisingly, the GROMACS benchmark performance is not as 
strongly correlated to floating point performance as the CASTEP benchmark. As expected, there is no correlation between GROMACS benchmark
performance and memory performance.

| Memory Channels                            |  0.02   |  0.18    |

[Figure 3](#fig3) reveals that there are two separate correlation lines - one corresponding to CPU-only performance and one corresponding to 
the systems with GPU-accelerators. By removing the GPU-enabled systems we can compute the correlation coefficients for the GROMACS benchmark
performance compared to the floating point performance of the CPU-only systems, see [Table 18](#tab18) and [Figure 4](#fig4).

| Aspect                                     | Pearson | Spearman |
|--------------------------------------------|--------:|---------:|
| Floating Point Performance (SP GLOP/s)     |  0.93   |  0.87    |
| Floating Point Performance (SP FLOP/cycle) |  0.88   |  0.78    |

This comparison shows a much stronger correlation than the comparison when the 
GPU systems are included, demonstrating that the scaling properties of performance with floating point performance is different 
across different architectures.

We also note that it appears that as you add more and more performance to the
processor architectures - which is mostly in the form of SIMD, rather than cores or increased frequencies - it becomes more and
more difficult for the GROMACS benchmark to extract the full performance potential from the architecture. For example, considering
just the CPU only results, the Intel Xeon Skylake Gold processors on the Peta4-Skylake system provide over 5x the theoretical
floating performance of the Intel Xeon Ivy Bridge processors on the ARCHER system but this translates into 1.7x the performance
of this GROMACS benchmark compared to ARCHER. Similar effects are seen for the Marvell ThunderX2 processors on Isambard and
the Intel Xeon Broadwell processors on Cirrus. This discrepency is even larger for the GPU-accelerated nodes on the Wilkes2-GPU
system where there is a theoretical FLOPS increase of over 36x in the resources used but this leads to a GROMACS benchmark
performance increase of just 2.7x. Of course, these effects may be affected by the size of the benchmark, with a larger GROMACS
benchmark able to make better use of the additonal SIMD performance available. However, this benchmark has been chosen by the
biomolecular simulation research community to be representative of their use of HPC systems and so this performance comparison 
is of direct interest.

## 5. Summary and Conclusions

We have run three different HPC application benchamrks on a number of different UK national HPC services with a
variety of different processor architectures. In particular, we compared the single node performance of the
applications across the different HPC systems.

In general, we were able to broadly correlate the performance of the different applications to particular
properties of the compute node architecture but there we a number of exceptions to these correlations that we plan
to investigate further, we describe these below.

### 5.1 CASTEP

CASTEP performance is strongly correlated to floating point performance of the compute node. However, the Isambard
(Marvell ThunderX2 Arm64) system showed lower performance than would be expected from the ordering of floating point 
performance of the different nodes. This could be due to a number of factors, potentially including:

-   Less mature compilers and performance libraries for the relatively new Arm64 HPC architecture.
-   The high core count on the Isambard nodes (64 cores per node) leading to more memory access contention or MPI intra-node overheads.
-   Process and thread pinning not functioning as expected.

We have recently gained access to one of the [HPE Catalyst UK](https://news.hpe.com/academia-and-industry-collaborate-to-drive-uk-supercomputer-adoption/)
systems with the Marvell ThuderX2 Arm64 processors and will repeat the benchmark runs on this
system to explore the performance of CASTEP on Arm processors further.

### 5.2 OpenSBLI

Perhaps surprisingly for a CFD benchmark, the performance of the OpenSBLI benchmark was found to be strongly
correlated to the floating point performance of the nodes rather than the memory performance (as is often
thought to be the case for CFD applications).

Two of the systems studied showed performance charateristics that did not map onto this general trend:

-   Isambard (Marvell ThunderX2 Arm64) showed much better performance than would be expected from its 
    peak floating point performance.
-   Thomas (Intel Xeon Broadwell) showed much worse performance than expected based on its peak floating
    point performance.

We have further investigations planned to explore these discrepencies and understand the performance differences
including detailed profiling of the benchmark running across different platforms.

We also plan to run the OpenSBLI benchmark on systems with GPU accelerators to gain further insights into 
performance differences.

### 5.3 GROMACS

The performance of the GROMACS benchmark was correlated with the floating point performance of the compute nodes.
When CPU-only systems were considered the correlation with floating point performance was extremely strong
suggesting, unsurprisingly, that the scaling properties of performance with floating point performance is
different across different architectures. There is an issue with the performance of the GROMACS benchmark on
the JADE GPU-accelerated system that requires further investigation - the results on the Wilkes2-GPU system with
the same GPU accelerators demonstrate that good performance can be achieved on the hardware.

### 5.4 Future Plans

This work has raised a number of issues which we plan to investigate further:

   - The performance of the OpenSBLI benchmark on the Isambard (better than expected) and Thomas (worse than expected)
     systems.
   - The poor performance of GROMACS on the JADE GPU system. This performance result was produced by the HEC BioSim
     and we are already in contact with them to discuss coordinating benchmarking efforts going forwards.

Other plans for future work include:

   - Comapring multinode performance across UK HPC systems with different architectures
   - Publishing performance profile reports for all of the benchmark applications across the different architectures
   - Working on adding machine learning benchmarks to the set of application benchmarks
